## Multiverse: `muid` **M**ultiversal *(Unique)* **Id**
**URL** [multiverse-os.org](https://multiverse-os.org)

Multiversal unique ID, or `muid` (or `mid`), is a time sortable base32 ids
library. `mid` is small and simple Go library with no dependencies with plans to
extend the functionality for an even more general-use id library. 

**This API and protocol is not static, major changes are planned or possibly an
entire rewrite. This may just be the first iteration to experiment with early
concepts. But it does still function as a basic simple time encoded, sorting,
base32 id library, and can be used reliabily if forked, but this specific
library will be in flux until alpha version is released.**

Ideally we will include mnemonic output, emoji, several other popular base-X and
give greater control over length. This should be paired with scramble keys and
basic database tools for Multiverse.

#### Development

Support for a variety of encodings including: `alphabetical`, `alphanumeric`,
`numeric`, `base32`, `base36`, `base58`, `base64`, and `URL-safe` encodings (and
custom definitions with variable-length support for short-ids, slugs, or
database indexes. In addition, add the ability to index ids by a developer
specified value. Resulting in a generic, broad-scope, multi-use id library for
the variety of needs for the variety of requirements of the Multiverse software
collection.
